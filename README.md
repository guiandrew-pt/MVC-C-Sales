# 18 Section - Project - Web System with ASP.Net Core MVC and Entity Framework

### ASP.Net Core

     • ASP.NET Core is an open-source modular web-application framework. It is a redesign of ASP.NET that unites the previously separate ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API into a single programming model. Despite being a new framework, built on a new web stack, it does have a high degree of concept compatibility with ASP.NET;
     • https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_Core
     • The framework works with a well-defined structure, including:
          • Controllers;
          • Views;
          • Models;
               • View Models;

     • Controllers: receives user interactions and treat them;
     • Views: defines structure and behaviour of user interface;
